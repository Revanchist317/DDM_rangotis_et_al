# Introduction 

Pre-processing 
You can use the MATLAB code in the directory Behavioural_psychophysics_and_preprocessing to load the data, visualise it, removed outliers, and combine it so the subsequent DDM scripts can analyse it. Run RT_analysis_monkeys for the NHP data and the Behavioural_wrapper for the human data, then run combine_subjects and remove_outliers.
